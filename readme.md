### Project: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project focuses on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The key aspects of the study include:

- **Dataset:**  
  A Kaggle dataset containing job titles and descriptions.  

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Preprocessing steps such as:
  - Stopword removal
  - Lemmatization
  - Tokenization

- **Model Embedding and Selection:**  
  - TF-IDF Vectorization for text representation  
  - Machine learning models:
    - XGBoost
    - Logistic Regression

- **Similarity Scoring:**  
  Cosine similarity was used to measure the similarity between text representations.
